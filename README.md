1. Open TinkerCad
Go to TinkerCad and log into your account.
Once logged in, click on Circuits and create a new circuit.
2. Gather Components
You will need the following components in TinkerCad:

AC Voltage Source: To provide the input.
Diodes (4): To build the bridge rectifier.
Resistor: As the load for the rectified output.
Oscilloscope: To display the output waveform.
Breadboard: Optional, but it helps in organizing the connections.
3. Build the Full-Wave Rectifier Circuit
Follow these steps to create the bridge rectifier:

Step 1: Place the AC Voltage Source:

Search for the AC Voltage Source in the components library.
Drag it to the workspace.
Set the desired voltage and frequency (e.g., 5V, 60Hz).


Step 2: Place the Diodes:

Place four diodes to form the bridge rectifier. The arrangement should be as follows:
Two diodes' anodes are connected to the AC input's positive terminal.
Two diodes' cathodes are connected to the AC input's negative terminal.
The other ends of the diodes form the rectified output.


Step 3: Add the Load Resistor:

Connect a resistor across the output terminals of the bridge rectifier.
This resistor represents the load.


Step 4: Connect the Oscilloscope:

Attach the oscilloscope across the load resistor to measure the output voltage waveform.
Make sure to connect the oscilloscopeâ€™s ground properly to avoid incorrect measurements.
4. Simulate the Circuit
Once the circuit is built, click the "Start Simulation" button at the top of the screen.
The oscilloscope will display the output waveform.
5. View and Analyze the Output
You should see a full-wave rectified waveform on the oscilloscope, where both the positive and negative halves of the input AC signal are converted into positive voltage.
6. Screenshot and Save Your Results
You can take a screenshot of the oscilloscope display showing the waveform.
If required, note down any measurements displayed on the oscilloscope.

Here is the visual representation of the full-wave rectifier circuit along with the output waveform displayed on the oscilloscope. The oscilloscope shows the continuous positive waveform resulting from the rectification process.
